# Collections of configurations and files which will need when change development environment

Includes

-   [alacritty.yaml](./alacritty/alacritty.yml) - configuration file for alacritty terminal. I used this config in Xubuntu 20.04. Don't forget to install JetBrains Mono Nerd font.

-   [tailwindcss-reset](./tailwindcss-reset/reset.css) - css reset which is automatically generated by tailwind. This will remove every styles predefined by browser.

-   [vscode-vim](./vscode-vim/setting.json) - keybindings for vscode vim, inspired by [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/). (My favorite IDE layer for neovim)
